## About MyRent App
MyRent is an Android app that facilitates between vehicle rental owners and prospective renters in the Yogyakarta area. Users can easily browse rental options, select vendors based on preference and budget and complete transactions within the app. Rental vendors can efficiently register vehicles, manage bookings, and communicate with renters through the platform. Developed to address the challenges of accessing rental services, MyRent aims to simplify the process of renting a vehicle while supporting local businesses. Through research and feedback mechanisms, the app aims to understand and fulfill the needs of both renters and vendors, thereby improving their overall experience. 

Based on our personal experience that it is difficult to find a vehicle rental, especially one that is trustworthy and able to provide the right price. So we present the MyRent app that strives to create a hassle-free and enjoyable experience, fostering a community where renting a vehicle for travel is easy and rewarding.
